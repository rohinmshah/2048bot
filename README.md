2048bot
=======

An example Chrome extension that plays 2048 by continuously pressing left and down.  Its purpose is not to be a good AI for 2048 - that would require minimax or some similar algorithm - it is meant to demonstrate a non-trivial example of a Chrome extension, as well as how one would go about building it.
